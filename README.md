### Image segmentation tutorial (semantic segmentaion)

**This is a step-by-step guide to building and understanding semantic segmentation**

- _we will discuss some preprocessing techniques specifically for medical images_

_Link to the dataset can be found on [MoNuSeg official domain](https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/Data/)_
